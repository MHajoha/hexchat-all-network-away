# All Network Away
A very poorly named HexChat script which automatically marks you away on all networks you are connected to once you do it on a single one.
Script written in Python3 for [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) IRC client.
>Because of HexChat restrictions, a <i>standard</i> Python installation of the same architecture as your HexChat installation is required.

## Installation
After downloading the script, you can just navigate to it in HexChat (HexChat -> Load Plugin or Script...) and load it.
If you want it to be loaded when you start HexChat, you need to throw it into
* ~/.config/hexchat/addons/ on Linux
* %APPDATA%\HexChat\addons\ on Windows
